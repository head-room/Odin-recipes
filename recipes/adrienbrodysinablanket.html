                <h1>Adrien Brodys in a Blanket</h1> 
                <!-- would be cool to have this info be swipable with pics like an ig carousel -->
                <p>Word on the street is that Adrien Brody is quite vain and likes to surround himself with admirers. Who better to admire Adrien than Adrien himself?
                </p>
                <p>You guessed it, Adrien Brody invested his Hollywood riches in a cloning machine to make sure that he is always surrounded by people who love him.</p>
                <p>To date, Adrien has cloned himself <em>eleven</em> times.</p>
