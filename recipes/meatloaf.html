                <!-- would be cool to have this info be swipable with pics like an ig carousel -->
                <p>This is the only Dwayne the Rock Meatloaf recipe that exists on the web. It is potentially a sensitive topic because to make it you would have to <em>kill</em> Dwayne.</p>
                <p>It exists in theory (for now), but im sure it would be delicious.</p>
                <p>If anyone can put me in touch with Dwayne, let me know.</p>
